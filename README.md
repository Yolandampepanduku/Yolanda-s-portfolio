Where passion meets proffessional growth
I am Yolanda Mpepanduku passionate about software engineering, web development, data analysis and artificial intelligence.

I am a motivated and enthusiastic Computer Science student, interested in learning and contributing to projects that challenge me to grow professionally. My goal is to create meaningful and impactful solutions. I am naturally an introvert, but that does not stop me from dreaming big and pursuing my goals with dedication.

The song I have chosen inspires me daily it motivates me to stay focused, gives me purpose, and reminds me to keep going even on challenging days.
